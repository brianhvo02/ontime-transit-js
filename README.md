# OnTime Transit - Bay Area Transit Data Visualizer

## Background

OnTime Transit is a data visualization project to allow users to translate data given by California's [Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC)](https://mtc.ca.gov) to a human-readable format in the browser using JavaScript and third-party libraries. Uses the [General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)](https://developers.google.com/transit) feeds consolidated by 511 SF Bay from all feeds provided transit services.

## Overview

With OnTime, users will be able to:
- See what transit authorities are in the Bay Area with GTFS feeds available to consume
- Find lines, stops, timetables, and scheduled departures for all provided transit services
- Find realtime data of current trips, vehicle locations, and updated departure times
- TODO: Generate statistics based on static and realtime data

## Instructions

- The train logo in the top of the screen is your home button! Use it to come back to the initial agency selection screen.
- The back button will take you one layer back up (i.e. routes -> agencies, stops -> routes).
- The Github icon will take you to the Github repository this app is stored in.
- The pause button will pause the transit alerts banner that scrolls through the screen.
- The marker button will take you to your current location.
- The map button will make the top layer disappear so you can explore the map.
- The info button will show you the welcome screen with instructions.
- Click on a space of the map with no features and it will take you to an overview of the layer you're in.
- Click on a feature to bring up the relevant data for that feature.
- Hover over a link to highlight the feature on the map.
- Right-click on a link to zoom to that specific feature.
